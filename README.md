# Colorful regions

Create color regions for your blocks of code and navigate easily. Currently it only supports JavaScript.

## How to use it

One option would be to use hex like this:

```js
//#region #6195ED

// Code for this region...

//#endregion
```

Note that you can name your region and still add a color to it

```js
//#region app model #6195ED

// Code for this region...

//#endregion
```

Or you can use the css names for colors

```js
//#region app model papayawhip

// Code for this region...

//#endregion
```

**Happy coding!**
