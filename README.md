# Colorful regions

Create color regions for your blocks of code and navigate easily.


## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the extension. People can add colors to their region by either appending hex code or using CSS color names, i.e


One option would be to use hex like this:

```js

//#region #6195ED

// Code for this region...

//#endregion
```

Note that you can name your region and still add a color to it

```js

//#region app model #6195ED

// Code for this region...

//#endregion
```

Or you can use the css names for colors

```js

//#region app model papayawhip

// Code for this region...

//#endregion

```


**Happy coding!**
